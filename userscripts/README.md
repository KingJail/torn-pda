# TORN PDA - Userscripts

Here you will find a list of tested userscripts working in Torn PDA.

This is due to the fact that preexisting scripts (for other tools, such as GreaseMonkey) normally require 
some changes in order to work with the app, as there might be missing libraries or different 
code loading times that are not directly compatible.

Also, where possible, a string named "_###PDA-APIKEY###_" has been introduced so that you don't have
to manually insert your API Key once again in the app.

We would appreciate if you let us know about any other scripts you are using in Torn PDA, so 
that we can add them to the list. Also, we can probably support you in making older scripts 
to work with Torn PDA.
